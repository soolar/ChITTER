# ChITTER

Character Information Toolbox, Totally, Except React

## NOT MEANT FOR PUBLIC USE

For real, this project is more about familiarizing myself with React than
the ludicrous undertaking that would be fully rewriting ChIT in React.

## Project Setup

```
yarn install
```

## Building

```
yarn build
```

And then you "just" symlink the KoLmafia files in to the appropriate places in your mafia folders.
I'd provide more detailed instructions if this was a real thing for other people to use.
