# ChITTER

Character Information Toolbox, Totally, Except React

## NOT MEANT FOR PUBLIC USE... YET

This project started more as a way to familiarize myself with React than
as an attempt to rewrite all of ChIT in React since I considered that a
"ludicrous undertaking" when I was starting.

Over the course of development I realized that it was much more pleasant
to work on than ChIT for a variety of reasons (mostly involving old code
that updating to be less of a pain to interact with would be a project of
almost this scale anyway), so it will be a replacement for ChIT eventually.

As for when that will happen, I do not know, I work on this in occasional
bursts in my spare time when I feel like it, so it isn't exactly coming
along rapidly, but it will be caught up eventually.

## Project Setup

```
yarn install
```

## Building

```
yarn build
```

And then you "just" symlink the KoLmafia files in to the appropriate places in your mafia folders.
I'd provide more detailed instructions, but it will be handled completely differently once it's
ready for public use, so there's not much point.
